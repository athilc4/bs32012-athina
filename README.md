## Mitochondrial DNA-Based Identification of Mustelid Species from Scat
This project designs a PCR-digest assay to distinguish between two closely related mustelid species, the black-footed ferret (Mustela nigripes) and the stoat (Mustela erminea), based on mitochondrial DNA found in scat samples.

### Project Overview
Scat-based species identification offers a non-invasive way to monitor and protect wildlife. This project aimed to:
- Align the mitochondrial genomes of M. nigripes and M. erminea
- Identify species-specific restriction sites using EMBOSS tools
- Design PCR primers to amplify regions containing unique restriction sites
- Validate the enzymes and primers using Primer3, Benchling, and BLAST
- Select optimal candidates for field application

### Tools Used
- Python 3.11.8 – scripting and automation
- Jalview 2.11.4.1 – sequence alignment
- EMBOSS 6.6.0 – restriction enzyme analysis
- Primer3 (4.1.0) – primer design
- Benchling (2025 Web version) – enzyme cut site confirmation
- NCBI BLAST – specificity validation
- GitHub – version control and project sharing

### Final Output
Three enzyme/primer combinations were selected based on quality metrics and in silico validation:
- NlaIV, BsrBI, and BaeI
- All primers yield amplicons between 97–160 bp and target ferret-specific restriction sites
